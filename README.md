Design Patterns
===============


What is a Design Pattern ?

Is a part of solution for solving a software development design, 
that patterns specially works as Group of Four (GoF) said.

In this case every pattern describe a problem that it happens many 
times, but this problem describe the core for the solution, so
you can use this pattern to solve a problems many times too.

Models like the design patterns let you abstract concept to solve
problems.

Design patterns are independent of the language programming.

What is not a design pattern?
- It's not a paradigm.
- There is not a silver bullet.

It lets us to have a common language (vocabulary).

We can identify alternatives to have flexible and reusable software.

We will be able to build complex software architectures and heterogeneous.

Design patterns favor the maintainability of the software.
