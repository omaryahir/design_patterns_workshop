Design Patterns
===============


What is a Design Pattern ?

Is a part of solution for solving a software development design, 
that patterns specially works as Group of Four (GoF) said.

In this case every pattern describe a problem that it happens many 
times, but this problem describe the core for the solution, so
you can use this pattern to solve a problems many times too.

Models like the design patterns let you abstract concept to solve
problems.

Design patterns are independent of the language programming.

What is not a design pattern?
- It's not a paradigm.
- There is not a silver bullet.

It lets us to have a common language (vocabulary).

We can identify alternatives to have flexible and reusable software.

We will be able to build complex software architectures and heterogeneous.

Design patterns favor the maintainability of the software.

###Â Layers
(Architecture)

We have a big application that requires descomposition.

We have a problem with mixed complexity high and low level, 
the petitions are maken from the low level to high level and
the answer in inverse sense.

Every layer we can describe for responsabilities, for example:

Clase: Layer 1 Colaborator: Layer 2 
Responsability: 
- services for layer 3
- assign tasks for layer 2

Layer 1 is the layer with low abstraction.

This pattern has a issue when you change the first level.
